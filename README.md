How do I approach designing software?
  When it comes to designing software, I first want to make sure that I am understanding what is being requested.
  Once I have a clear understanding, the next step for me would be to create an outline of the requirements.
  This allows me to manage what needs to be done and have a set idea of what constitutes finished.
  This can be applied in several ways, including managing time and resources of various projects.

How do I approach developing programs?
  The process is mostly similar when it comes to developing programs as when developing software.
  I like to know what is needed, a clear outline of what the program needs.
  This would translate into a list that would provide that outline.
  Of course, when it comes to developing either software or programming, good practices are paramount.
  Ensuring that the code is easy to edit and is understandable means adding comments and grouping together lines that relate to each other.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Through the skills taught to me in computational graphics, I can start to build upon them through courses that further the foundations that has been started.
  These skills, while they may not necessarily be paramount in whichever field I go into, can still be helpful.
  For instance, I can use these skills to provide visual aids if I am ever in a position when discussing a project with a client or presenting an idea to a team.
  As a bonus, I really enjoyed learning these skills and hope to further them, even if it is in my own time or for my own interests.
